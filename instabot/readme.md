very simple script to see who does not follow you back

it will output the results as a text file on your machine, probably in your user folder 

to run, open up your terminal and find the instabot file.
then run python3 GetUnfollowers.py 

This takes 90 seconds to run on my machine, but it varies by number of followers.
