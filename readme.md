very simple script to see who does not follow you back on instagram

it will output the results as a text file on your machine, in the instabot folder

to run, open up your terminal and change directory to the instabot file. then run 'python3 GetUnfollowers.py'

This takes 90 seconds to run on my machine, but it varies by number of followers.
